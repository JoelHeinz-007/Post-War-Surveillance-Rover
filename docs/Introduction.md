# Introduction & Background

## The Problem
Post-war zones remain dangerous long after conflicts end due to:
1. Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) / Landmines.
2. Structural instability of bombed buildings.
3. Leaking toxic gases or chemical residues.

## The Solution
We propose a **Wireless Surveillance Rover** that acts as the "first line of entry." Instead of risking human life, this rover enters the hazard zone, streams data, and detects threats using onboard sensors.
